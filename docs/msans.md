**My Job:**

In this project I have been mainly in charge of designing and testing all the items in the game. This includes testing and iterating them 
until they reached an optimal point. 

Items changed a lot through the sprints. Some of them were dismissed :( 

Addittionally I've been doing QA during the development of the project.
