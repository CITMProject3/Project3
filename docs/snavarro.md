**My job:**  
During the development of our game my main role as a team member was **UI Designer**. My responsibility is to devise and layout all the elements of the interface so that the player can interact in a simple and clear way and the scrum could work with it.

I have also been **UI Programmer** of the interface during the half of the project, coding my own design. In phases where other areas required of more programmers, I was the only programmer of the scrum.

In addition, I have been an **Item Designer**, specifically I have been in charge of finishing the item Makibishi (ancient japanese artifact used to slow down the enemies by placing it on the ground), and helped as **Vehicle Designer**, at the very early stages of production.

**What I've done:**  
- **Design - *User Interface***  
  - User Movement Flowchart.  
  - All Screens and HUD, with which I had to do:  
    - Visual Scheme of Elements disposition.  
    - Description of the visual display, duration on screen and functionality of each Element.  
    - Definition of each button's functionality.  
  - Constant Test, Indentification of problems and Improvement (Iteration).
