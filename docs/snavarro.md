**My job:**  
During the development of our game my main role as a team member was **UI Designer**. My responsibility is to devise and layout all the elements of the interface so that the player can interact in a simple and clear way and the scrum could work with it.

I have also been **UI Programmer** of the interface during the half of the project, coding my own design. In phases where other areas required of more programmers, I was the only programmer of the scrum.

In addition, I have been an **Item Designer**, specifically I have been in charge of finishing the item Makibishi (ancient japanese artifact used to slow down the enemies by placing it on the ground), and helped as **Vehicle Designer**, at the very early stages of production.

**What I've done:**  
- Design of the User Interface  
  - User Movement Flowchart.  
  - All Screens and HUD, with which I had to do:  
    - Visual Scheme of Elements disposition.
    - 
  - Constant Improvement and Iteration.  
- Programming tasks, such as:  
  - Team Selection Screen.  
  - Player Position displayed at the beginning of the race.  
  - Wrong Direction on the HUD.  
  - Use of Left Stick on the Main Menu.
  - Minor UI bug fixes.

- Finish Makibishi
  - Balancing the Slow and duration while active on the ground.
  - Improving Feedback on hit.
