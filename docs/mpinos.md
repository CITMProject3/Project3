**_My Role:_**   

As a Lead Artist, my job consisted in organize the art department and manage art tasks inside Hack & Plan. Also had the responsibility to do quality checks and advise on style decisions within the team.
I started working inside the UI scrum doing a few pixelart portraits of the characters. Later on, I moved to the Levels scrum to work on some environment textures. Finally, I worked with [Guillem](gtravila.md) to implement particles inside the game.

And, in my opinion, my biggest contribution to the whole project: memes.  
They boost the general morale of the team and they're fun... somewhat fun? What not to love, ah?

- Ausi, the release maker!
