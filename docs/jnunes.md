**My Job:**

My job has consisted on manage all the team, stablish pipelines of production, coordinate diferents departments and scrums, take strategical decisions & keep track the development. 

The project starts officially 10th of Febraury. Subject's teacher, simulated to be studio's CEO and explained us the new game we were going to develop. An asymmetric co-op kart racing game, with the following game pillars:
- Stylized kart racing game with relatable characters.
- Asymmetric cooperative experience.
- Short and replayable sessions.

Also gave us subject's calendar. I modified a little bit adding Alpha 2 delivery to split 4 weeks sprint in 2.

In Concept Discovery and Vertical Slice 1 the team work by departments, because we were gathering info and making some tests, so it wasn't necessary create interdepartmental scrums. In this period of the production, leads had a lot of work supervising their departments (pre-production is a chaotic period).

The first delivery, Concept Discovery, was an information gathering in all aspects of the project. 
- Code studied viability of different technologies and all the time needed to develop it. 
- Art did a studio of possible art styles, type of characters, vehicles, etc.
- Game Design made reviews of multiple kart racing games, looking for its core mechanics.

After this first approach to the game, we decide the theme of the game: Yo-kais. What matches perfectly with the game pillars. The process was a little bit complicated, but briefly, we decided democratically.

Vertical Slice 1 & 2 were a very early prototypes, without nothing similar to a final level or art implmented, very fwe mechanics, etc.
