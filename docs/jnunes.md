The project starts officially 10th of Febraury. Subject's teacher, simulated to be studio's CEO and explained us the new game we were going to develop. An asymmetric co-op kart racing game, with the following game pillars:

The first delivery, Concept Discovery, was an information gathering in all aspects of the project. 
- Code studied viability of different technologies and all the time needed to develop it. 
- Art did a studio of possible art styles, type of characters, vehicles, etc.
- Game Design made reviews of multiple kart racing games, looking for its core mechanics.

After this first approach to the game, we decide the theme of the game: Yo-kais. What matches perfectly with the game pillars.
