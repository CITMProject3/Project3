**_My Job:_**  
As Lead Programmer, my main job consisted in distributing and verifying that all tasks were completed in time and ensuring some work quality. I have been providing aid to all programmers (and non-programmers that needed to use a system) in order to improve the efficiency of the team.

As a Programmer, since my main role allowed me to have an extensive knowledge of all the systems, I have been working in different aspects of the project. My most specific feature has been the animation system.
