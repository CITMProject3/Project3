**My Job:** 
First of all i started being 3D environment artist, creating props to use on our tracks with their concept arts or references, their UV and textures. 

Afterwards on the development, when gameplay had evolved, i had to start creating (following the same method we used for the objects) models like Daruma (random box to collect in-game items)
and some item like Makibishis.

Then, i had to take again two of the props created to make a rework, because they have been created fast to fulfill the deliveries.

Finally, i transformed into a level designer to change one of the two tracks into something beautiful and enjoyable to wander, from filling the map with props to changing the entire heightmap and repainting it.

_**What i've done:**_

- Creating environment props (In chronological order):
	- Old temple columns with farols, Screenshot 1: 1732 triangles Screenshot 2: 2064 triangles (In-engine screenshots). (Finally not included because of the map aesthetic direction had changed.)

	- Firsts map texture creation and painting to test (In-engine screenshots). (Before have tools enough to paint it in engine and have a good textures and textures resolution.)
