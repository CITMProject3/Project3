**My Job:**

In this project I have been mainly in charge of making the characters and karts of the game. At the beginning of the project,  I made a research about what kind of characters we could do that fitted with the idea of the product owner. 

After that process of searching information and creating proposals, I began to create and make the characters and vehicles. That tasks included  the concept art, the High Poly Modeling, the retopology, the Uvs  and texturing. All of it to have a proper Low Poly Model for our game.

Afterwards,  due to a project necessity, I had to do the animations of one character (Kozo). From that moment we closed the creation of characters and karts and I started to do the animations, which included the Rigging and Skinning, the different animations and a correct exportation to work suitable in our engine. 

Finally, when the animations were done, I did some props that were necessaries to decorate one of our tracks.
