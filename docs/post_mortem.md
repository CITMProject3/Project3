## Post Mortem

Ri-Karts born as a college project, is in fact a whole subject. Likewise the game pillars was chosen in function of team members and their skills, game pillars chosen: 
- Kart racing game
- Asymmetric co-op gameplay
- Relatable characters
- Short & replayable sessions

The Yo-Kais theme was chosen later by us, cause it matches wll with the game pillars and it was the most voted theme proposed. The entire game development elapsed during the 2n quarter of our college (CITM), from beginning of february to beginning of june, 4 months. A very limited time to develop the game and also the engine in parallel.

### What went right

1. **We have 2 game designers checking and testing the kart's behaviour during all the development**. Thanks to this, the kart's control feels very nice: maneuverability, drifting, turbo, etc. We have had a lot of problems with physics during the development and have the security that the kart's always it would be ok it was great.

2. **Map Generator Tool**. We had an amazing tool that allowed us to make new circuits very fast. This was very useful to check maps and for level designers in general.

3. **Simple Art Style**. Ri-Karts' art style was chosen with the idea that our level 3D artists doesn't have experience. This way we could made props good enough to enhance the map.

4. **Crunch sessions at the end of every sprint**. Before every delivery, at the end of the sprints, we always met in a college's classroom to ensure that everything was ok. This sessions were key and aboslutely necessary in the development, due to we didn't have an office, the moments when we were all together helped a lot, especially in what a communication refers.
