**My Job:** First, I started by researching how to implement an scripting system. After the selection, I worked doing an scripting system in which the programmers can work with C++ in parallel. Preparing the system for working in debug and release, making the component to attach to gameobjects. Also, I added the system to the engine's resource manager and made a guide and explain how to do scripts to the team.
After I finished it, I started working with the gameplay team doing the script that control the camera position regarding the kart and doing the items, where I did the first approach of the items and after I focused on finishing the makibishis (and triple makibishis).
Finally, I made that the engine can recognise the connection/disconnection of controllers in-game and the makibishi behaviour improved and fixed.
