### My Job:
#### - Concept Discovery & Vertical Slice:
In the early phases of the project my main objective was to look for information about other "kart-racing" games and collect their most remarkable tracks. With those tracks, i had to document every design decision that i found interesting and viable for our game.

Besides, i started doing some concepts of possible tracks for our game. Lots of them were discarted, but i got some good ideas that could be implemented in the current game.
