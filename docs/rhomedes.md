## My Job:
### - Concept Discovery & Vertical Slice 1/2/3:
In the early phases of the project my main objective was to look for information about other "kart-racing" games and collect their most remarkable tracks. With those tracks, i had to document every design decision that i found interesting and viable for our game.

Besides, i started doing some concepts of possible tracks for our game. Lots of them were discarted, but i got some good ideas that could be implemented in the current game. You can see some of them here:

Finally, one of my ideas was the implementation of a two-sides map, with mountain roads and a dock, what is still in the final map. And also the bifurcation and trifurcation to allow the players to make decisions. 

### - Alpha 1/2/3: 
In this phase we found the heightmaps. The designers had to learn this way of tracks creation and at this point was when my first track appeared in the engine. I had to do several iterations to create a map with a correct flow and strategic player decisions. In adittion, in this phase i worked on checkpoints and colliders distribution. This is the final heightmap i used to work with and checkpoints/colliders distribution:

My map inspired some of my teammates and allowed them to create things like the amazing final map. 

------
Once we reached an advanded phase of our project, i was asked to created an easy-mode track, as an initial/tutorial course for newbie players. And thats what i did, using one of my previous concepts(concept2) i created a "circular" track with some jumps easy for everybody. 
This was its Alpha 3 state:

### - Beta & Gold:
In this last phase, i was moved to QA where i could work in a new area, and where i got more connected with the game. Besides, in this last days, i've been working in the 2nd map, trying to create a better prop distribution and some slopes with the terrain. I am very sorry to say that my map didn't reach the Gold because we could match both levels theme, but i am proud of this unfinished but loved circuit.
I leave some screenshots of the current state of the map:

### - Conclusion:
In this semester as a designer i have learned so much about the concept of IDEA, and the feeling of frustration. Now i know that there are not good or bad ideas. An idea is a door, you face one and you can close it or open it. Most of the times you close it, but it guides you to another one that will make you reach the best way to create.
