**My job:**

My job as a designer was mostly related with relegating Yokai characters to a karts' game. I was in charge of finding suitable characters for a game of this kind and creating a context and story in lines with the topic and genre of _Ri-Karts_.

Although these tasks came under the initial stages of the project, I took them into consideration to carry out my other tasks as, for instance, when assisting the artists with encapsuling the attitude of the characters in their animations. All the other varied tasks I had dealt with can be ascertained below.

*May main areas of work:*


* Looking for references

* Characters’ design

	- Relatable characters from the most popular Yokai
	- Delimit the list taking into account:
		- Modelling and animation possible issues caused by the shape of the character
		- Balanced classification (heavy and light)

* Narrative
	
	- Short, concise and coherent
	- Mix the Yokai topic :mount_fuji: :ghost: with cars :car:

* Animation design assistance

	- Set animation states

* Particles’ first design approach	_(Most of them used as references, and many may not be implemented due to time limitations)_

	- Particle systems that could help giving feedback
	- Design of particle systems (moment of activation, location of emitter, division in subsistems, priority...)
	- References of all the designed systems


* Items design assistance (Evil spirit redesign) _(Redesign kept but with input changed)_

	- Redesign of Evil Spirit
	- Set Evil Spirit's parameters, balancing and testing
