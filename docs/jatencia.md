**_My Job:_**

I Began working on the engine's editor usability, starting with the gizmos to make it easier to modify the game objects of the scenes.

Later on, when the scrums groups were formed I was moved to be the gameplay programmer, and was tasked to programm the car gameplay with the Bullet physics as basis, working side on side with the gameplay designers to se what could and couldn't be achieved.

Due to later issues with walls collisions, it was decided to move from the bullet physics basis to a custom physics basis that was earlier prototiped. So i was tasked to assist in this conversion.

After that, for the final line, I mainly solved issues and bugs.
