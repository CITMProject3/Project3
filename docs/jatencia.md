**_My Job:_**

I Began working on the engine's editor usability, starting with the gizmos to make it easier to modify the game objects of the scenes.

Later on, when the scrums groups were formed I was moved to be the gameplay programmer, and was tasked to programm the car gameplay with the Bullet physics as basis, working side on side with the gameplay designers to see what could and couldn't be achieved.

Due to later issues with walls collisions, it was decided to move from the bullet physics basis to a custom physics basis that was earlier prototyped. So I was tasked to assist in this conversion.

After that, for the final line, I mainly solved issues and bugs.

**_What i've done:_**

- Editor Transformation Gizmos
    - Grants direct translation, rotation and scale of the game objects with the mouse.
    - Local and World transformation and correlation between parents and children.
- Create Car Component
    - Inspector component that together with a component collider gives a GO the functionality  of a Car.
    - Done as component instead of a script because the scripting system was still in development at the time.
    - Permited designers to change the Kart gameplay values durinng testing.
- Bullet Physics Kart Gameplay 
    - First version of the Kart Gameplay that worked with Bullet physics.
    - Included all basic designed gameplay mechanics: acceleration, steering, brake, push, drift,  acrobatics and turbos.
    - Also served as basis for prototyping new mechanics.
    - Had to be changed by using a custom physics basis due to some issues related with the kart collision with walls that seemed to be unsolvable
