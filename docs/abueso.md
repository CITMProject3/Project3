**My Job:** 

First of all i started being 3D environment artist, creating props to use on our tracks with their concept arts or references, their UV and textures. 

Afterwards on the development, when gameplay had evolved, i had to start creating (following the same method we used for the objects) models like Daruma (random box to collect in-game items)
and some item like Makibishis.

Then, i had to take again two of the props created to make a rework, because they have been created fast to fulfill the deliveries.

Finally, i transformed into a level designer to change one of the two tracks into something beautiful and enjoyable to wander, from filling the map with props to changing the entire heightmap and repainting it.
