**My Job:** 

At the start of the sprints I started at the Art department making concepts and and theme propositions.

Later I started modeling and texturing as many props as I could so we could choose from a large list and adapt them later.

Then we needed to adapt the maps and build them so I started placing props to an early verion of the Ricing Fields.

At the end I ended up doing QA and basicaly tweaking the drifting so that you could take the curves properly (which was a difficult task at the time)

_**What i've done:**_

* **First Circuit Version**

Placing all the props in the map. Which ended up not being on the final build.

  * **Wood Texture**
  
  We needed our own wood texture and we needed it a lot because most of our props were made of wood so, after some attempts I finally got this. The next props are texturised using this texture.

* **Other:**

  * **QA:**
  
  For the whole last sprint I worked with Miquel Giron√©s publishing issues to Github to be solved and testing as much as we could.


  * **Drifting:**
  
  Finally worked a whole day long with design and code (for a couple implementations) to get the drifting values of the final version of the game which is very similar to Mario Kart.
