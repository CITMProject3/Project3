**My Job:** 

At the start of the sprints I started at the Art department making concepts and and theme propositions.

Later i started modeling and texturing as many props as i could so we could choose from a large list and adapt them later.

Then we needed to adapt the maps and build them so I started placing props to an early verion of the Umi Gohan.

At the end I ended up doing QA and basicaly tweaking the drifting so that you could take the curves properly (which was a difficult task at the time)

_**What i've done:**_

- Creating environment props (In chronological order):
