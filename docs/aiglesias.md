**My job:**    
First I started as a kart designer and after giving some concept ideas I knew that it wasn't what I liked, so I changed to level designer.
And I loved it! I'm proud to say that I'm the designer of the Umi Gohan level.

**What I've done:**   
- First we did a lot of testing with the technologies we were developing to see how we could start designing the levels, and finilly 
we came out with the way, by using heightmaps. This is the development of the heightmaps until the actual one:

- After every heighmap I had to put all the colliders, checkpoints, paint the terrain and put some props, where the artists really helped.

- Here you have some images of the development of the map with lots of iterations between them:
