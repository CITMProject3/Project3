//Indispebsable

Fix Car values (Speed, maneuverability, acceleration, bounciness...)
Drift (try messing around with the horizontal speed)
Turbo
Fix camera FOV (it's probably deppendant on the speed, and now it's recieving a different number than before).
Fix item interactions
Second player Push


//Secondary

Fix animation calls
Make the car slide slightly on it's side when turning too much?
Collision between cars (OnCollision between cars, probably call the function WallHit())
Make wheels turn


// In Progress
Attach a collider to the car that can detect bullet interactions  (David)


//Done
Fix jump (upon leaving ground contact, the kart Y speed becomes 0. It should keep the speed it had previously)
