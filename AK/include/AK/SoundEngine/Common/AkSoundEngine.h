		///		- Music segments cannot be looped. You may want to listen to the AK_EndOfEvent notification 
		///			in order to restart them if required.
		///		- In order to restart at the correct location, with all their tracks synchronized, music segments 
		///			take the "look-ahead time" property of their streamed tracks into account for seeking. 
		///			Consequently, the resulting position after a call to SeekOnEvent() might be earlier than the

		/// Notes specific to music switch containers:
		///		- Seeking triggers a music transition towards the current (or target) segment.
		///			This transition is subject to the container's transition rule that matches the current and defined in the container,
		///			so the moment when seeking occurs depends on the rule's "Exit At" property. On the other hand, the starting position
